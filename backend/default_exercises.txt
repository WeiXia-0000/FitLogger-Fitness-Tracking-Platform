Lift the bar from the rack, bend forward at the hips, and keep the back straight with a slight bend in the knees. Lower the bar towards the floor until the elbows are completely straight, and keep the back flat as the bar is pulled towards the belly button. Then slowly lower the bar to the starting position and repeat."

    "description": "Place a barbell in a rack just below shoulder-height. Dip under the bar to put it behind the neck across the top of the back, and grip the bar with the hands wider than shoulder-width apart. Lift the chest up and squeeze the shoulder blades together to keep the straight back throughout the entire movement. Stand up to bring the bar off the rack and step backwards, then place the feet so that they are a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Sit back into hips and keep the back straight and the chest up, squatting down so the hips are below the knees. From the bottom of the squat, press feet into the ground and push hips forward to return to the top of the standing position."

    "description": "Place a barbell in a rack at about shoulder-height. Dip under the bar so that it rests behind the neck across the top of the back and shoulder blades, and grip the bar with the hands just outside the shoulders. Raise the chest and squeeze the shoulder blades together to maintain a straight back throughout the entire movement. Stand up to bring the bar off the rack and step backwards, placing both feet approximately hip-width apart and squarely set on the floor with the toes pointed forward. (Tip: for more development on the outside of calves point feet slightly inwards.) Keep a slight bend in knees, and press the toes into the ground while lifting the heels up. Pause at the top, and slowly roll the heels back down to the floor, then pause again and repeat for the desired number of repetitions."

    "description": "Stand behind the barbell with the feet about shoulder-width apart, the toes slightly rotated out, and the shins almost touching the bar. Sit back into the hips slightly while keeping a straight back so that the chest is lifted upward, and bend forward to grip the bar in an over-under grip with one palm facing up and the other facing down. Squeeze the bar in the hands and sink back onto the hips while pressing the feet into the floor. Keeping the back flat, push the hips forward to move to standing position. Finish standing in a tall position with the shoulders pulled back and the legs straight. Return to the starting position by shifting the weight back into the hips and keep the back straight while allowing the knees to bend. When this movement is done properly, the glutes and the back of the thighs should feel the work, NOT the back."
